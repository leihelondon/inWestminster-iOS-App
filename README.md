# inWestminster-iOS-App
inWestminster is an iPhone App that facilitates international students from the University of Westminster to find services, events and tips and meantime offers “FOOTPRINT” as a feature for enjoyment. It's built in Objective-C and uses Core Data and is optimised for iPhone 5(s) and iOS7. This is an ongoing project.
